#Login via Facebook

For simplicity, I have setup the site to authenticate via Facebook.

1. Navigate to the site admin page: [http://sistineskin.com/wp-admin/](http://sistineskin.com/wp-admin/)
2. Click the link labled 'Connect with Facebook'
3. If you are not already logged into Facebook, you will be prompted to do so now.
4. You may be taken back to the WordPress login page. If so, click the link to log in.
