# Artist Pages

The site is set up so that all posts categorized as 'Artist' will be aggregated on the [http://sistineskin.com/artists/](http://sistineskin.com/artists/) page. Each listing on this page will be of the artist's name, image and brief description. 

* Make sure that the images alternate on the [Artists](http://sistineskin.com/artists/) page. 
* Take care of where you insert the More Tag.
* Include a link to the artist's image gallery on Facebook
