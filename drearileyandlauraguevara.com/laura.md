# Laura's Bio 
___Romance to Sweat to___

Laura Guevara is a little lady with a big love for family, friends, and unexpected fun.   On the surface this bilingual babe is cuter than a button, while on the inside she is just like her favorite color, red...CALIENTE!  This sugar and spice and everything nice truck driving dame loves country music and country boys.  Reading, writing and relaxing keep her busy while she is waiting for her towering Alpha to arrive.
