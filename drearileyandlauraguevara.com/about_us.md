#About Us

Serving it up Texas-Style, Laura Guevara and Dr&eacute;a Riley are two sassy, sexy and sinfully hot ladies who have come together to bring their literary talents to the table of hot romance literature.   What follows is a full-course meal of alpha-males, strong, intelligent females and mouth-watering romance of the sensual ilk.  Laura brings the country-flavored, south-of-the-border spiciness and combines it with Dr&eacute;a's chocolate-inspired, vanilla-coated sweet goodies for some appetizing morsels of stories. They live far-apart in two separate Texas towns, and for their families, the state of Texas and the rest of the free-world, this could be a good thing.  No-telling what kind of mayhem, Laura's family and Dr&eacute;a's Cowboy would have to rescue them from on a daily basis if they resided any closer to one another.   Poor Dee-Ooh-G&eacute;&eacute; (promis that's his name) would never get to see his "momma" Dr&eacute;a because she'd be off riding with Laura in her pick-up truck setting it off whilst in search of a tall glass of cowboy, alpha-male for Laura.  Poor little dog would have even more attitude than he has now! 

 When not regaling the MFP Posse with their stories of chaos and mischief, these two ladies spend their free-time reading and composing smoking-hot literature and taking care of their families.  Each brings their own skill sets and interests to their individual and partnered stories.  Dr&eacute;a likes to cook, Laura is an adventurer at heart and we may gain further insight into these two ladies through their stories.
