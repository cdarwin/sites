**Starting at 9pm**

Every week a different scientific topic is covered with presentations from scientists and science educators, with some hands on experiments or patrons viewing specimens under microscopes. Past salons have dealt with lunar impact craters and evolution of life on earth, with meteorites from Mercury and the asteroid belt brought in for display and another dealing with the importance of plankton, where tables had plankton and bioluminescent  jellyfish filled petri dishes that were observed under a microscope. Bats, butterflies, and liquid nitrogen have also been studied.  Science Salons are then followed by telescopic stargazing on the back deck. Salons are always free but are 21+.
