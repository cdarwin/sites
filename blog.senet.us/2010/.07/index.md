I am one of the very few masochists who decided to plop down and pay full pop for an HTC/Google Nexus One back in late March of this year.  I came from an iPhone 3GS and I don't regret a single second of my switch to the Android platform.  Nearly all of my satisfaction of the platform is owed to the amazing group of developers behind the [CyanogenMod ROMs](http://www.cyanogenmod.com/).  Ever since Google released Android 2.2 "Froyo" AOSP, the group has been feverishly porting features from previous CM releases as well as adding some really nice new features to the ROM.  This ROM has been reviewed before, but I want to take some time to highlight some of my favourite bits.

## ADW.Launcher

Previous versions of the CyanogenMod ROMs shipped with an ever so slightly modified launcher application that just made the default home screen a bit more flexible.  In a very short period of time, AnderWeb has come onto the scene with his amazing [ADW.Launcher](http://jbthemes.com/anderweb/category/adwlauncher/) and it is now the default in CM6.  Most recently, ADW has been updated (v1.0.1 as of this writing) to include theming support as well.

You will find a new item in the main __Settings__ menu labeled __ADWLauncher__.  This is where you can tweak a plethora of options for the main interface of the phone.  Without turning this into a review of ADW Launcher, I would like to point out a few features that I think make it a really nice addition.

Under __Screen preferences__ you can choose to hide the status bar to gain some precious real estate.  I, personally, find this feature distracting since it only applies to the launcher so switching between applications and the home screen becomes pretty inconsistent and unsettling.  Here you can also change the number of _Desktop Screens_ to display and which one should be the default.  Also of note is a toggle for _Auto Stretch_ and selectors for number of columns and rows to use on the desktop.  I use a 5x5 layout with the _Auto Stretch_ toggled on to avoid overlapping icons.  Finally, I set _Desktop scrolling speed_ and _Desktop overshoot_ to zero.  __Drawer Settings__ effect the display of the applications list and has many options similar to those listed under __Screen preferences__.  I chose to use the _Horizontal Drawer_ toggled on which uses the Galaxy S implementation similar to an iPhone.  __Preview Settings__ pertain to some desktop preview feature that I have never used.  __System Preferences__ has quite a few options worth noting including setting actions for swiping up or down on the screen, a toggle for the orientation sensor, and a toggle to prevent the system from killing the launcher in a resource crunch.  __UI Settings__ has a handful of toggles for a new DockBar that will grant quick access to up to six more app icons and options for _Secondary ActionButtons_ and hiding icon labels like you see in my screen shots above.  Finally, ADW.Launcher features a menu backing up and restoring your ADW and desktop settings.  I have included [mine](adw_settings.xml) in case someone likes it.

## CyanogenMod Settings

Another new item in the main Settings menu is towards the bottom and is appropriately labeled CyanogenMod Settings.  Here you can tweak a number of system specific options beyond just your main launcher.

## Misc.
