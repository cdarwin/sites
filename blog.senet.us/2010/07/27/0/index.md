Moved Into a House
======================

I recently moved into a pretty nice little house not too far from work.  I really like the area and this is the first house I have lived in on my own.  This is my story of how it came about.

I have spent the last ten years bouncing around townhomes every few years.  There was a very brief period where I was a starving musician and lived on a single bed in the living room of my guitar player's one bedroom flat.  I've come a long way since then and I'm pretty proud of that fact.  What I'm not so proud of is the fact that I still have a shitty credit score.  I no longer have any outstanding debts, but I haven't done anything to fix my score yet.  Thusly, I am still stuck with renting for another few years.

I hate moving with a passion.  It is always a huge pain and the end result is rarely justified.  I was a tenant with my previous landlord in a nice little two bedroom, two bath townhouse for three years.  I would have stayed there for another three except that my landlord decided it was time to raise my monthly lease rate.  Fair enough, but I haven't received a rise in wages for as long as I lived there.  This provided the impetus for seeking new lodging.

With the help of friends, I narrowed my results and settled on the spot I'm on about today.  It is a three bedroom, one bath home with a garage and a decently sized back yard.  The place was built in 1979 and refurnished about nine months ago.  This includes a new roof and shingles, hardwood look laminate flooring throughout most of the house, tile in the laundry and wash rooms, carpet in the bedrooms, and new kitchen appliances and cabinetry.  

The garage is just large enough to fit my little Civic, but I don't plan to use it as such very often.  For now, it provides storage for everything that doesn't have a place in the house as well as my homebrew gear.  The back yard is fairly substantial.  I have three good sized dogwoods and a pine tree providing ample shade for lounging in the hammock with a good book on a clear afternoon.  

The living room area seems to be sufficient.  I donated my old, embarrassing couches to goodwill, so I'm now on the hunt for replacements.  I'll have a better idea once those are in place, but I suspect there will be no problems.  I have appropriated the middle sized bedroom for my study/office/instrument storage.  The small bedroom will eventually get a bed for guests.  

The master bedroom is a secret to be shared with only the most worthy of guests.  A series of obstacles, not so dissimilar to Atreyu's quest to stop the Nothing of _The Neverending Story_ must be completed before entry is granted.  If you find yourself in the master bedroom, I probably don't hate you.

My neighbours on either side seem pretty great so far.  The older lady on the one side doesn't mind about parties and the dude on the other side seems to be in a perpetual purple haze.  As soon as I get some seating, both inside and outdoor, I would like to invite everyone over to christen the place with a proper get together of good company, good music, and good beer.  Consider yourself warned.
