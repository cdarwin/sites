New Year's Resolution
=====================

I have decided that I will do a better job of writing down my musings this year.  I would like to commit to at least one informational post a month.  If I can come up with more, then so be it.  Hopefully, I can provide some valuable insight into the things that I am intimately familiar with for others who may not be so fortunate.

I will start this off by just giving a brief update into my own life.  I have already made some progress in a positive direction this year.  One of my biggest steps so far has been the completion of an Advanced Driver Improvement course.  I needed to do this as a final step towards regaining my driving privileges.  After seven years of not driving at all, I will finally be legal again and able to help out my friends and family.

I have decided to no longer waste any more of my time or money on University studies.  I know, it seems like a bit of a waste, but I think it is for the best.  I have looked back on the amount of hours and money I have put into obtaining a degree and I currently think it best to just get some certifications and start moving forward.  I don't plan on staying in this town forever and so I want to make some changes that will help me move forward immediately.  I may reevaluate this decision in the future, but for now I have signed up to take a [CompTIA Linux+](http://www.comptia.org/certifications/listed/linux.aspx) certification and shortly after that I plan to go for a [Red Hat Certified Engineer](http://www.redhat.com/certification/rhce/).

Also, I am going to make a serious effort to work on some of my personal projects.  I have a book store to create for [Shara Azod](http://www.sharaazod.com/).  Once I get her site all polished up, I will put some effort into giving [Drea and Laura](http://drearileyandlauraguevara.com/)'s site a makeover as well.  I also have some ideas about a hosting solution based around [Uriel](http://uriel.cat-v.org/)'s great [werc](http://werc.cat-v.org/) solution, but Orby doesn't like them.

In the area of music, my brother and I are seriously preparing for the debut of our little two man band.  I have wanted to do something with him for ages, but we never seemed to be able to make it work out.  We finally decided that we would get together a few times a week to rehears for an open mic night here in town.  We've got some really neat ideas for the set and what we do have down so far is really fun and interesting.

I have been brewing beer!  A great mate of mine introduced me to the idea some time towards the end of last year and we are starting to get somewhat of a schedule down.  We get our kits from the local [HomeBrew Den](http://www.homebrewden.com/) and the whole process takes anywhere from five to seven weeks depending on the type of beer we do.  So far we have brewed an IPA, a black beer, a Hefeweizen, a stout and we should be brewing another high gravity stout in the next week or so.

Finally, I am making some changes in my personal life as well.  Without going into details or embarrassing anyone, I just want to say that it has been a long time coming.  I am glad to be moving forward with my life.  I plan to use this time to better understand myself and my limitations.  

I am really looking forward to the good things to come this year.
