Off to a Good Start
===================

This year I am really starting off on the right foot.  For some reason, I have been extremely motivated.  I am fairly excited about the things that have happened already or are in the works.  So far I have officially reinstated my Florida Class E Driving License, filed my taxes, brewed a new batch of stout, and have an interview scheduled with [Coraid](http://www.coraid.com/) in Athens, GA.

In regards to my driving privileges, I would like to clear the air and avoid all confusion.  I never got a DUI or anything else all that reckless.  The story is that I can be quite a slacker at times.  A few minor traffic violations got compounded after not paying them which caused the infraction to escalate to a suspended license.  On three separate occasions I was caught driving with a suspended license.  This put me in the category of Habitual Traffic Offender and I lost my license for five years.  I got on just fine without a license the whole time, so I let that go for a total of seven years.  Now I am legal again and plan to be a much more careful and considerate motorist.

Filing my taxes was a bit of a pain, but worked out in the end.  I filed through TurboTax, but in my rush I spelled my own name incorrectly.  During the time it took for the IRS to reject my filing I received a 1098-T which is a Tuition Tax Statement.  I refiled, including my tuition statement this time, to find out that Uncle Sam will be reimbursing me for that full amount!

Max and I just brewed a new batch of beer.  Our last batch was a stout, but we decided to do another anyway.  This time we chose the high gravity (think high alcohol content) [Black Hat Imperial Stout](http://www.homebrewden.com/product_info.php?cPath=182_64_210&products_id=916).  I'm pretty excited to see how this turns out.  I checked on it this morning and it has kicked off good and proper already.  I should be able to pull the hose tomorrow night and replace it with a simple airlock.

Now, I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I am the most excited about what might happen in my interview.  Coraid just secured [10 million USD](http://brainstormtech.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2010/01/25/startup-with-all-star-backers-aims-to-disrupt-storage-market/) in VC funding.  Brantley posted to [9fans](http://9fans.net/archive/) that they were hiring for a couple of positions.  I decided this would be, at the very least, a good excuse to update my [resume](http://senet.us/resume_2010.pdf) and possibly a chance for a serious career opportunity.  Well, I had a phone interview very shortly after submitting my application and Erik has scheduled an on-site interview on Monday.  I will be crossing my fingers that everything goes well.
