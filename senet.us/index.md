I am a technology enthusiast and currently focus mostly on mobile and web-centric computing. I tinker a bit with Android and iOS mobile operating systems. I also spend a fair amount of time taking advantage of the various Amazon Web Services for building and hosting web applications. I have a particular affinity for the werc web anti-framework that assists in bringing you this very page.

In my day job, I am the Systems Administrator for the [Program in Neuroscience](http://www.neuro.fsu.edu) at Florida State University. Neuroscience is an interdisciplinary program including mostly [Biology](http://www.bio.fsu.edu) and [Psychology](http://www.psy.fsu.edu) faculty members, graduate students, doctoral candidates and post-docs. There, I maintain the internal network for the Biomedical Research Facility which includes a numbe of the Neuro faculty's labs as well as the Dean of Arts and Sciences' lab and a large Lab Animal Research facility on the first floor. I maintain services such as email, webmail, websites, ftp, dhcp, dns, backup, and large file storage for the program and building. All of my servers run some version of either FreeBSD or Linux. I also provide desktop support for everyone in my program and building. Desktops that I maintain are a range of "beige box" PCs and Apple Macs. I have been with Neuroscience since 2007. Before that I was with FSU's [College of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences](http://www.med.fsu.edu).

I enjoy hiking, cycling, reading and watching musicians when I want a break from technology. I recently finished [*Little Brother*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VTZSH2/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title) by Cory Doctorow and am currently in the middle of a few books including [*A Scanner Darkly*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nLVV1FDtXY) by Philip K. Dick and [*Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business*](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0023ZLLH6/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title) by Andrew Postman. When I remember to take them, I upload photos to [picasaweb](http://picasaweb.google.com/118285902950180656780/). When I bother to, I keep my code under mercurial's version control system [hosted here](http://hg.senet.us/). I somewhat infrequently post my musings on a [werc powered blog of sorts](http://blog.senet.us/).

I try to surround myself with folks more technically capable or educated than I. Some of those folks include [Uriel](http://uriel.cat-v.org/), [Anselm](http://garbe.us/), [Dr. Todd](http://www.toddalbert.com/), [guypat](http://www.nullamatix.com/), and everyone who contributes to the various [suckless.org](http://suckless.org/) projects.
