## Technical Consultant
TAOS Mountain Inc.<br />
San Jose, CA | 2011-present

Most recently I have worked as the Lead Architect and Engineer on a continuous integration project for Intuit. The project goal was to move the product development team of a rather large Windows based C++ SaaS application into a more agile development environment. I have migrated their code base from a `subversion` repository to `git` to help facility more frequent and painless merging for the Development team. I have setup `jenkins` for the QA team to facilitate continuous integration and to orchestrate multiple, concurrent builds for testing. I have implemented `puppet` for the Operations team to help facilitate configuration management and deployment automation.

## Senior Systems Engineer

I developed all system software and web applications for the Program in Neuroscience at Florida State University. I consolidated hardware on a shoestring budget using Xen and VMWare ESXi hypervisors. I managed a team of support technicians serving roughly 200 faculty, staff and students distributed across the main FSU campus including the Lab Animal Research facility and the lab and office of the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. 

## Lab Manager

I managed and maintained the LockLink Access Control Management System consisting of over 70 control points and over 700 user credentials. I was the security liaison for over 35 Office of Technology controlled access points throughout the College of Medicine. My time also consisted of being the unofficial resident Macintosh support technician for the entire college.  

## Technical Support Specialist

Tallahassee, FL | 2004-2005

I shared duties of managing over 500 end users running Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients over a gigabit ethernet and 54Mb wireless network. I was responsible for the timely delivery and upgrade of computer hardware and software on a routine basis. I was required to troubleshoot and resolve many hardware and software problems for end users.  

## Technical Consultant
